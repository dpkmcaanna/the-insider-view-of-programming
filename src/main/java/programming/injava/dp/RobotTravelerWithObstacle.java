/*
 *  Given two dimensional matrix, write an algorithm to count all possible paths from top left corner to bottom-right corner. 
 *  You are allowed to move only in two directions, move right OR move down. There are few obstructions as well, means few 
 *  cells are blocked and you cannot travel that cell.
 * 
 * Approach:
 * In recursive solution given in “Count all paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix” just check for condition 
 * if cell is not blocked.
 * 
 * In Dynamic programming solution, we need to take care of two conditions, first we are not solving it for blocked cells 
 * and while solving for other cells do not involve blocked cells.
